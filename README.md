# The Misspell Challenge
<!-- endhide -->

Learning in public means collaboration, and you don't have to be an expert to collaborate. Misspellings come to the rescue! They're the perfect ice-breaker for open-source contributions — fixing a misspelling is easy and requires almost no GitHub or Git experience.

## 🔷 How to fix a misspelling in a 4Geeks lesson:

![edit on GitHub](https://github.com/breatheco-de/the-misspell-chalenge/blob/master/assets/github-logo2.png?raw=true)

1. Click the pencil icon that says "Edit on GitHub" at the top right of the lesson; the lesson source file will become editable.  
2. Correct the misspelling in the lesson.  
3. Finally, click on `"Pull Request"` to propose the change.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Find a misspelling in any of the 4Geeks lessons, projects, or exercises, and create a `pull request` with the fix.

> 👉 **IMPORTANT**: Please find another project to fix — this one has already been corrected enough. 😂
